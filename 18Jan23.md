- `new` keyword is used as:

```java
ClassName obj = new ClassName();
```

- further, the `obj` can be used to refer to __methods__ inside the `ClassName`

<br>

- _We can `import` all_ ___classes___ by using `*`

```java
import java.util.*; // imports classes in util

import java.*; // only imports packages inside java
```

># JVM Architecture

<br>

### 1.Classloader

- has `Loader`, `Linker`, and perforsm the task of `Initialisation`.

<br>

> #### By default, if  `int` is decared but not defined, its value will be ___0___ :)

<br>


>### Variables

<br>

- ___Instance Variable___ : 0 by default, each object has its own copy of its `instance var` 

    - Different objects have their own copies fo this _var_.

<br>

- ___local Variable___ : ___`Do Not belong`___ to the object. Created at the time of `calling`.

<br>

- ___Static Variable___ : followed by _keyword_ `static`, its value remains same for eachj and every instance/object. __AKA__ ___`Class Variable`___. 

    - It is value is updated for everyone (obj).

    - __NOT__ a part of the _Object_, takes memory somewhere else.

### 2. Memory Areas :one: :zero:
<br>

- ___Class Area___ : Stores `static vars`

<br>

- ___Heap___ : Stores `vars`/`data` belonging to `objects`

<br>

- ___Stack___ : Holds `thread's data` in case of `multi threading`. Also stores `local vars`.

<br>

- ___PC Registers___ : To hold the `current` instructions.

<br>

- ___Native Method Stack___ : Holds `methods` belonging to `C/C++` libs.

<br>


### 3. Execution Engine

- Runs the `byte code`

<br>

>### 4. Native Method Interface


>### 5. Java Native Libraries

>##### End JVM Arch

> ### Naming Conventions

<br>
<br>

- ___Class Names___ : First Letter should be `capitalised`

```java
class FinalTournament{}
```

- ___Method Names___ : First Letter of each `word` is `caps` __EXCEPT__ first word.

```java
void distributPrizes(){};
```

<br>

- _Identifier_ must NOT start with a number

- `50 keywords`
