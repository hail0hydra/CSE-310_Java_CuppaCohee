> Continuing with `try` and `catch`. Expation handling.

> ### Finally ;)

<br>
<br>

- If we want some code to always be executed, even in case of undefined eception, we use `finally`.

- A good example is [here](../Codes/nestedTry.java)

- After finally, one `try` block is complete, you can't add a catch after `finally`.

- even if no `catch` handles exception, finally ___executes___.

- It is optional.


<br>
<br>

> #### `try` can ___NEVER___ be alone. Either with `finally` or `catch` or __both__

<br>
<br>
<br>

> ### Generalised Exception

<br>

- Handled with data type `Exception` or `Throwable`.

- Can handle all types of exception

- Must be at the last of all specific expetions else throws error.

```java
catch(Exception e){

}
```

or 

```java
catch(Throwable t){

}
```

> ### `throw` keyword :ghost:

<br>
<br>

- :warning: `throw` __must__ be inside `try-catch` block

- we can define, predefined exception as well as our own defined exception.

- To define our own `exception`, we create a class that ___Inherits___ `Exception` class.

- A good Example of both cases of throw is [here](../Codes/raise2.java)


<br>
<br>
<br>

> ### `throws` keyword

<br>
<br>

- Simply declaring exception.
