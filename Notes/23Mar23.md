> ### Anonymous Classes :ghost:

<br>
<br>

- Object is created at the same time the class is defined.

- Example is [here](../Codes/anon.java):exclamation:

- They are like local class, except that they don't have a name.

- It consists of the following:

```
    1. The new operator

    2. The name of interface to implement or class to extend.

    3. Parenthesis conatain arguements to a constructor.

    4. A body, which is a class desclaration body.
```

<br>

- Doesn't have any constructor

- In case of nested class, two seperate class files are created.


```powershell
Outerclass.class
OUterclass$Nestedclass.class
```
