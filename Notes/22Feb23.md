# Today

<br>
<br>

> - _today we will looking at what is actuallt `inheritance` in java_

<br>
<br>

- Object oriented behaviour allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behaviour from other classes.

- In JAVA, each class is allowed to have ___one direct super-class___.


<br>
<br>

> ### Inheritance

<br>

- class which is __inherited__ is called `super-class`

- class which __inherits__ is called the `sub-class`.

<br>
<br>

```

- The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it.

- If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, the version of parent class will be executed.

- If an object of a subclass class is used to invoke the method, the version of subclass class will be executed.

```

<br>

```java
//in
Car c = new Mustang();
```

- `Car c` is reference variable and `new Mustang()` 

- so this will call the `drive()` method of `Mutang` class.

- but the compiler `(javac)` will think that `Car` class's ___drive()___ method is being called, but during execution, something else happens. 

<br>

> #### :warning: IMPORTANT POINT 

<br>

- Something like `EARLY BINDING ` and `LATE BINDING` in ___`C++`___

<br>
<br>

> A good is example is [here](../Codes/inheritance.java)

<br>

- [here](../Codes/inheritance.java) the line `cc.fly()` will give ___COMPILE TIME ERROR___ as the compiler, for above stated reasons thinks that we are calling `fly()` of `Car class`, but Car class __doesn't have__ any such method.


<br>
<br>

- Here is the ___`compile time error`___

```java
PS F:\LPU\Semester 4\JAVA - CSE 310\Codes> javac .\inheritance.java
.\inheritance.java:32: error: cannot find symbol
        cc.fly(); // compile time error
          ^
  symbol:   method fly()
  location: variable cc of type Car
1 error
```

<br>
<br>

>#### ___Method Overriding___:

<br>

- redefining `parent` class method inside `child` class.

- it __always__ takes place in case of `inheritance`.

- if `child class` method is accepting a perameter, then it is __NOT OVERRIDING__ :skull:


<br>

> __NOTE:__ function/method overloading is different form this

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

>#### ___Method Overloadding___:

<br>

- Same name but different [`Signature`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_signature) in the class or __one in parent one in child__ :). 

- Defining two or more methods with same name but different set of parameters - Different `Signature`

<br>

```java
void drive() {

}

void drive(int x) {

}

//valid case
```

<br>

```java
int drive(){

}

void drive(){

}

// not a valid case, further it leads to AMBIGUITY
```

<br>

- The overloaded methods can exist in same class or on in base class and other in derived class.

<br>

> [Here](../Codes/methodOverloading.java) is a fine example of that

<br>
<br>

> Compile time error

<br>

```java
class Parent {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Child");
    }

    public int drive(int a) {
        System.out.println("Int Drive");
        return 0;
    }
}

public class methodOverloading {
    public static void main(String...args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        p.drive(0);     
    }
}
```

<br>

- Because `class Parent` doesn't have `int drive()` function/method.

<br>

- Signature can vary depending upon occuring of arguments.

```java
void drive(double x, int y){};
void drive(int x, double y){};
```

- Both above are valid cases. In `Child`, it is `Method Overloading`


<br>
<br>


<br>

- Check the output of this
```java
class Parent{
    public void drive(double x, int y){
        System.out.println("First");
    }
}

class Child edxtends Parent{
    public void drive(int x, double y){
        System.out.println("Second");
    }
}

public class QuestionOfFeb22{
    public static void main(String...args) {
        Child p = new Child();
        p.drive(3,5);
    }
}
